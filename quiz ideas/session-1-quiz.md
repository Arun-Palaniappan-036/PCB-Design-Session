1) Why 90 degree bends are not preferred in PCB routing ?

   ANS_1: In high voltage PCBs, any sort of sharp shape will concentrate the high electric field and make a dielectric breakdown and this is not ideal. Even though 90 degree bends
   are not going to affect our low voltage projects, it is a good practice to avoid and kind of sharp bends.
