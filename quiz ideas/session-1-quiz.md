### 1) Why 90 degree bends are not preferred in PCB routing ? - ARUN

   ANS_1: It becomes tough to manufacture, the outside corner of that 90-degree angle has the likelihood of being etched narrower than your standard trace width

### 3) which of the following is NOT a use of 555 timer circuit ? -ARUN

   ANS_3: the 4 options are- timer delay, pulse generation, oscillator, resonator 
   
         correct answer- resonator is not a use of 555 timer IC
         
### 4) How much minimum space should be left between traces so that they come with no manufacture defect ? -ARUN

   ANS_4: the 4 options are- 0.002" - 0.006", 0.006" - 0.010", 0.010" - 0.014", 0.014" - 0.018"
   
         correct answer- 0.006" - 0.010"
         
### 5) Decoupling capacitors must be as close as possible to the respective IC to which they are connected. -ARUN

   ANS_5: True or False
   
         correct answer - True
